This plugin adds a Job Priority field to each Hudson job.  Jobs with higher
priorities will be ran before jobs with lower priorities when there are jobs
waiting in the build queue.  This can be very helpful when one wants to add
low priority jobs but wants to have higher-priority jobs run first when
hardware is limited.
